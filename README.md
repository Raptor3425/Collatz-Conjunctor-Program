Hello world! This prgram uses the Collatz Conjunctor to do operartions. 
How it works is if the number is odd then you would times it by 3 and add 1. If it was even you would divide it by two.
Even = 3x+1
Odd = x/2

Then omething intresting happens where the number you choose will get to a point wherre it gets into a loop. 
Specifically the 421 or 124 loop. So any positive whole interger eventually gets into this loop.

Instructions: 
The last line of the prgram line 35 you will see: Collatz_Conjunction(); 
Just place the number of your choice in the parenthisis and hit the arrow on the top right hand corner to run the script.
Thats it! Have fun but DO NOT put Nan into the parenthesis it will crash.
