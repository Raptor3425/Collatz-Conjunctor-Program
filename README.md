Hello world! This prgram uses the Collatz Conjunctor to do operartions. 
How it works is if the number is odd then you would times it by 3 and add 1. If it was even you would divide it by two.
Even = 3x+1
Odd = x/2

Then something interesting happens where the number you choose will get to a point where it gets into a loop. 
Specifically the 421 or 124 loop. So any positive whole integer eventually gets into this loop.

Instructions: 
In the last line of the program line 35 you will see: Collatz_Conjunction(); 
Just place the number of your choice in the parenthesis and hit the arrow on the top right-hand corner to run the script.
Thats it! Have fun but DO NOT put Nan into the parenthesis it will crash.
